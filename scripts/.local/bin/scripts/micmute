## Simple script to mute microphone
##

# This script requires that both source 4 and 5 are
# at the same state (i.e. both muted or unmuted)
# else the script will cause unwanted behavior!
# Currently, this is fixed by muting the mic
# on start up in .xinitrc.

# mute whatever source that controls the thinkpad led
pamixer --source 4 -t

# mute the actual mic
pamixer --source 5 -t
