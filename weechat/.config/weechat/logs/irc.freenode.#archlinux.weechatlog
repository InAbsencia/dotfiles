2017-02-01 13:19:57	althorion	I’m starting to feel like I’m some kind of alternate dimension. chrome://gpu shows Video Encode/Decode hardware accelerated, I have no problems playing OpenCIV online and YT videos run full hd @60Hz without dropping frames…
2017-02-01 13:20:00	shreyansh_k_	ThomW, I have both intel and nvidia gpu.
2017-02-01 13:20:05	althorion	And you tell me it can’t be…
2017-02-01 13:20:16	Celmor	I use /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-keyboard.conf like shown here https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Keyboard_configuration_in_Xorg#Using_X_configuration_files to configure my keyboard, after boot it's configured correctly, but if I re-plug my keybaord these settings from that file are forgotten/not read anymore...

If I enable it and get keys from the preloader-signed AUR package, will I be able to deal with it all at once and not worry about secure boot again, or will I have to update keys every time I update my system? Alternatively, I could disable secure boot, but I'm not sure if this is a good idea since

2017-02-01 19:40:21	Gaffel	Ubiquity, UEFI is a much needed change. UEFI firmwares can now start updating themselves by connecting to a network and phone home to get the latest firmware. Less user errors and easier upgrading, safer upgrading etc etc. This feature is poping up here and there and the next computer you buy might have that feature.

2017-02-05 14:02:14	tetero	When you have a 'secondary' inet entry. How do you actually use that?
2017-02-05 14:02:33	magesing	Hi everyone, I'm trying to install slic3r from AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/slic3r/, however, I'm in dependancy hell as it depends on a bunch of other things that I also need to get from AUR. . . is there a tool that I can use to automatically install dependancies from AUR? Thanks.
2017-02-05 14:02:43	tetero	In this case both the normal and the secondary inet entry ip-addresses both work but they don't seem to be handled the same way

2017-02-05 16:59:43	earnestly	poisonby: What do you use instead?  E.g. ADSL ISPs which use ptppoe

2017-02-05 16:59:46	grawity	elgrande: SSTP with sstp-client might be a better option

2017-02-05 17:00:21	Zasshu	i never bother to try using linux on my phone since android itself is gud enough for me 
2017-02-05 17:00:22	elgrande	grawity: I have no choice at the moment since pptp is what company provides unfortunately
2017-02-05 17:00:28	grawity	dysfigured: then just install pkgfile locally
2017-02-05 17:00:32	dysfigured	oh.
2017-02-05 17:00:40	grawity	dysfigured: or even use pacman -F for the same (though pkgfile is faster)
2017-02-05 17:00:42	poisonby	earnestly: I assumed we were talking about a VPN using PPTP.
2017-02-05 17:00:42	elgrande	andreyv: 1. checked, since it works with same router on windows

2017-02-05 17:01:37	Zasshu	i use openvpn cause it seems to be the best from what i heard
2017-02-05 17:01:48	grawity	pppd doesn't even support eap-ttls/eap-peap I think
2017-02-05 17:01:52	elgrande	andreyv: 2. loaded did not help, still no gre packets are recognized
2017-02-05 17:01:55	SwooshyCueb	openvpn is pretty user-friendly
2017-02-05 17:02:16	elgrande	i have no firewall set up or anything that could block them though

2017-02-05 17:02:24	grawity	earnestly: PPPoE also generally defaults to the same, but it only goes as far as your ISP (maybe even only as far as the DSLAM ~1-2 km away), and it doesn't even try to do encryption anyway

2017-02-05 17:43:47	thrice	ljmf00: keep in mind, you shouldn't REALLY downgrade in arch, but the kernel is generally safe (unless you use external modules), as it's totally independent.  https://archive.archlinux.org/packages/l/linux/

Is it because bash tries to parse the whole line as an boolean expression, and it uses decent short circuiting to only do the doX if condition is true, or doY if it's false?

The only guess I found is the error "cannot determine ethernet address for proxy ARP", which could be stand for problems with dns. I can confirm, that the dns resolution doesn'T work with the stick, but also the routing to dns Servers doesnt work,

2017-02-11 13:47:06	mirk0	is there a way to get font rendering same as infinality did? I have followed https://gist.github.com/cryzed/e002e7057435f02cc7894b9e748c5671 and rendering is bad for special chars, for example hearts are overlaped when they're in row, < sigb is not in middle but low, etc.

2017-02-11 20:59:51	linux_dream	ok i have another question. on some sony vaio laptop (and HP like mine), there is a hardcoded stuff into the BIOS or something, that makes the system look for microsoft.efi in a particular path.   efibootmgr and grub won't work unless one rename grub_x64.efi into the microsoft.efi file and replace the original file.   my question is, say i remove the HDD and put a new SSD into my laptop instead, what would happen? IS it even
