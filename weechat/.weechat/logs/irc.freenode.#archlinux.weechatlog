2017-02-01 13:19:57	althorion	I’m starting to feel like I’m some kind of alternate dimension. chrome://gpu shows Video Encode/Decode hardware accelerated, I have no problems playing OpenCIV online and YT videos run full hd @60Hz without dropping frames…
2017-02-01 13:20:00	shreyansh_k_	ThomW, I have both intel and nvidia gpu.
2017-02-01 13:20:05	althorion	And you tell me it can’t be…
2017-02-01 13:20:16	Celmor	I use /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-keyboard.conf like shown here https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Keyboard_configuration_in_Xorg#Using_X_configuration_files to configure my keyboard, after boot it's configured correctly, but if I re-plug my keybaord these settings from that file are forgotten/not read anymore...

If I enable it and get keys from the preloader-signed AUR package, will I be able to deal with it all at once and not worry about secure boot again, or will I have to update keys every time I update my system? Alternatively, I could disable secure boot, but I'm not sure if this is a good idea since

2017-02-01 19:40:21	Gaffel	Ubiquity, UEFI is a much needed change. UEFI firmwares can now start updating themselves by connecting to a network and phone home to get the latest firmware. Less user errors and easier upgrading, safer upgrading etc etc. This feature is poping up here and there and the next computer you buy might have that feature.
