# Iyyel's dotfiles

This is a snapshot of my [(@Iyyel)](https://github.com/iyyel) dotfiles. I use GNU Stow to manage them with a script that automates the installation process for me. You can try it out on your own machine - but I am sure you'll need to reconfigure some of the files for everything to work. If you need any help, feel free to contact me.

## Setup

- Application Launcher: `bemenu`
- Music Player: `spotify`
- Shell: `zsh`
- Terminal Emulator: `kitty`
- Text Editor: `nvim`
- Web Browser: `firefox`
- Window Manager: `sway`

## Installation

1. Install `stow` (or `xstow`)
2. `cd ~`
3. `git clone https://github.com/iyyel/dotfiles`
4. `cd dotfiles`
5. `./bin/.bin/dotstow`
