# .files

_This is a **snapshot** of my [(@InAbsentia)](https://github.com/inabsencia) dotfiles. I use GNU Stow to manage them with a install.sh
script that automates this process for me. You can try it out on your own machine - but I am sure you'll need to reconfigure some
of the files for everything to work._
