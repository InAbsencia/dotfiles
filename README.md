# InAbsentia's dotfiles

This is a snapshot of my [(@InAbsentia)](https://github.com/inabsencia) dotfiles. I use GNU Stow to manage them with a install.sh script that automates the installation process for me. You can try it out on your own machine - but I am sure you'll need to reconfigure some of the files for everything to work. If you need any help, feel free to contact me.

## Setup

- Application Launcher: `rofi`
- Music Player: `ncmpcpp`
- Shell: `zsh`
- Terminal Emulator: `urxvt`
- Text Editor: `nvim`
- Web Browser: `qutebrowser/firefox`
- Window Manager: `bspwm`

## Installation

1. Install `stow`
2. `cd ~`
3. `git clone https://github.com/inabsencia/dotfiles`
4. `git clone https://github.com/inabsencia/bin`
5. `cd dotfiles`
6. `./install.sh`
